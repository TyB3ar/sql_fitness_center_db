This is my submission for the assignment for Module 5 Lesson 2, SQL. 

The following images labeled by task are screenshots taken of my work from the MySQL workshop, where the database and included data was created:
- The images labeled 'task_1' and 'task_1_second_picture' reflect the data that was added into each table 'Members' and 'WorkoutSessions'.
- The image labeled 'task_2' reflects the change in session time for member 'Jane Doe' from 'Morning' to 'Evening'.
- The images labled 'task_3' and 'task_3_second_picture' reflect the changes to each table where member 'John Smith' has cancelled his membership, and was removed from both tables.

This submissions reflects my understanding of SQL and simple use of DML(data manipulation language) to manipulate data. 

Thank you!
